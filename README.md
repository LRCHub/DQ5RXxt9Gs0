```lrc
[00:34.66] As the waves come crashing down
[00:38.50] All your walls mean nothing now
[00:41.13] A warrior
[00:43.08] Left in the dark
[00:45.49] Who are you now
[00:47.06] When you hear the howl
[00:52.23] The sirens are calling for you
[00:56.43] You're praying the power's in you
[00:59.64] Don't swing your lifeline
[01:02.08] Here comes a new tide
[01:03.95] "Welcome to the other side"
[01:17.45] 
[01:22.99] Forgive my nightmares
[01:25.29] That climb through your shadows
[01:27.64] Oh, I dare
[01:29.56] You bring them the battles
[01:31.41] Their green flares
[01:33.88] Will signal the end of it all
[01:37.39] But we will not fall
[01:39.52] We will not fall
[01:44.17] No one will fall
[01:47.80] Bring down your walls
[01:52.45] Fall
[01:54.45] 
[02:25.05] Two minutes left till midnight
[02:28.76] Two minutes left till midnight
[02:33.57] Two minutes left till midnight
[02:37.07] Two minutes left till midnight
[02:41.75] Two minutes left till midnight (midnight)
[02:50.87] (Midnight)
[02:54.88] (Midnight)
[02:59.48] (Midnight)
[03:03.63] (Midnight)
[03:20.13] Midnight
